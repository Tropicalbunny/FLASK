## Development

---

### Inital idea
the inital idea was simple, to create a basic hangman game where the game would select random words, i learned quickly that this would not be enough


### Final Idea
my final idea incoperates login functions so that each user can create their own libraries and update words within them.

i decided to go for a simple retro look, as hangman is a very old game i took insperation from the old 2d text games. and tried to keep with tradition. i thought the font "Klee One" was perfect for this, i felt the font brought the rather sharp lines of the rest of the site together.

as this design was more of a retro look, i tried to be minimalist while trying to bring the website to the 21s centruy.
#### Notable Design Decisions.


## Testing

---

### Pre code Testing
i used figma to help test potential designs, this took a lot of time as i couldnt get the idea correct.

### During Code Testing
i often used print to show variables that i struggled getting to pass in and out of functions some notable:
- the word being pulled from the database was not being displayed correctly
- i had trouble with the "edit" route, print allowed me to debug where the code was going wrong, the issue ended up being a typo within the route.
